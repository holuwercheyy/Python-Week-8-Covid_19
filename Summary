Summary & Conclusions
In this analysis, we explored COVID-19 vaccination data and its impact across selected countries.
The visualizations and calculations provided key insights into how countries managed their vaccination campaigns and the disparities that exist globally.

üîë Key Conclusions:
Italy led the selected countries in both absolute and per capita vaccination coverage, reflecting strong logistics and early access to vaccines.

 demonstrated a significant effort to scale up vaccinations, but due to its large population, its per capita vaccination rate remains lower than in the USA.

North America and Asia showed the lowest vaccination coverage, highlighting ongoing challenges in vaccine access and distribution in many African countries.

üåç Patterns & Observations:
Vaccination campaigns globally accelerated post mid-2021, likely due to increased vaccine production, distribution networks, and international aid initiatives.

Data anomalies were observed, including missing values and reporting inconsistencies in several countries, especially lower-income regions.
This points to the need for stronger global support in both vaccine access and data transparency.

üí° Final Note:
This data-driven exploration underscores the importance of equitable vaccine distribution and robust data systems to monitor public health interventions effectively.
